
Welcome to the Fallout Vault Availability Tracker!
The purpose of this program is to help Modders keep track of 
which Fallout Vaults have appeared in a previous Fallout Title,
expanded media, or in other Mods

Each Vault has been given various Tags, such as: Canon, Non-Canon,
Already Modded, Other Canon Property, Fallout Bible and which game,
if any, they appear in.

When launching, you will be asked to set the range of Vault Numbers
you wish to search by, starting with the lowest then the highest.
The Canon number of public Vaults is 122.

Then you will be asked whether you wish to only see Non-Canon and
unused Vault Numbers. I have included Vaults that have appeared or
mentioned within the Fallout Bible since I couldn't find a definitive
location for any of them.

Canon: Vaults that appeared in a previous Canon Fallout Game.
Non-Canon: Vaults that were considered by Bethesda but got scrapped
	   for whatever reason, or are part of a Non-Canon Property.
Other Canon Property: Vaults that have appeared or will appear in
	   other Fallout Media outside the games.
Fallout Bible: Vaults that have made an appearance in the Fallout
	   Bible.
Already Modded: Vault Numbers that have already been created by
	   Modders. Haven't been able to find EVERY Vault mod, but
           I made sure to get the big ones.
